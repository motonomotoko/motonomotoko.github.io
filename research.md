Chromosomes are living information media within the cell, integrating digital genetic information with their physical entity. The processing of this information relies on molecular interactions, thermodynamic fluctuations, and mechanical forces. Our lab is interested in the dynamic mechanisms that define the dual nature of chromosomes.

# My interest
A central focus of our current work is understanding meiotic homolog pairing. During this process, homologous chromosomes (homologs) must search and recognize one another and align precisely and tightly along their entire lengths while avoiding entanglements with unrelated chromosomes. This phenomenon provides one of the clearest demonstrations of the dual nature of chromosomes as both informational and physical entities, and it unites all our labâ€™s core research interests.
Our current goal is to uncover molecular and physical mechanisms of meiotic homolog pairing across eukaryotes. By combining advanced live-cell imaging with quantitative approaches, we aim to develop a multi-scale, integrated framework that connects molecular-level DNA recombination, chromosome-scale crossover patterning, and nucleus-wide chromosome organization.

# Research projects
Major projects in our lab will focus on the following questions:
1. Chromosome dynamics: How do chromosomes move, organize, and interact in the crowded environment of the nucleus and the cell?
2. Algorithms in the cell: How is genetic information efficiently searched and recognized? 
3. Evolution of chromosomes: Why and how do chromosome size, number, and shape vary so widely across eukaryotes?
